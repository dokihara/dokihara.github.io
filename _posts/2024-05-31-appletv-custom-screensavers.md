### Custom AppleTV Screensavers!

One day, one of my coworkers asked if it would be possible to change the screensaver that is on the AppleTVs across our campus. I thought that would be a great idea, and started searching the web to see what options were available. I came across a few app-based solutions but they seemed limited and I would have to force the AppleTV into single-app mode for it to work all the time. 

Then, I stumbled across something called Store demo mode.
